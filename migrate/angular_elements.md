# Angular Elements

You can package new Angular code as [Angular Elements](https://angular.io/guide/elements#angular-elements-overview) - which custom elements, so they behave like plain HTML elements.

This allows you to move your AngularJS components little by little to Angular. However It does not provide a migration path for services and routing, so it would still require ngUpgrade.
