# Using Webpack

Using a module loader like webpack is essential for migrating to Angular, and should already be part of every modern programmer's tool set. Webpack will make it easy to manage all the different files that a modern, modular AngularJS 1.3+ project prescribes. This includes bundling the application for distribution or deployment.

Using webpack will also simplify a programmer's Angular workflow, since the easiest way to work with Angular is with TypeScript. It enables great tooling and allows modern syntax and operators to be transpiled to ES5 or even ES3 to work in older browsers.
