# Migrating To TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of modern JavaScript and, as its name suggests, uses a type system. This can have an enormous impact on developer tools, providing richer auto-complete and static analysis.

Angular was built using TypeScript, and supports decorators, which provide meta information to Angular. While it is possible to use Angular without these features, the syntax feels more "natural" with TypeScript's decorators.
