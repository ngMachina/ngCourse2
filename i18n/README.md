# Internationalization in Angular

Internationalization \(commonly abbreviated to _i18n_\) is the process of adapting software and web applications to work with multiple languages (e.g. English and Korean) and/or locales (e.g. Canadian English and British English). This enables the software to be translated and localized with no, or very little, engineering changes.

By ensuring that your application supports multiple languages, you can reach a broader audience and ensure a smooth user experience for users speaking different languages.
